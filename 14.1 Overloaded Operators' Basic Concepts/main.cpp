//ordinarily, the comma, address-of, logical AND, and logical OR operators should not be overloaded

//If the class does IO ops, define the shift operators to be consistent with how IO is done for the built-in type.
//If the class has an operation to test for equality, define operator==, and operator!=
//If the class has a single, natural ordering operation, define operator< and other relational operators.
//Logical and relational operators should return bool, arithmetic operators should return a value of the class type.
//assignment and compound assignment should return a reference to the left-hand operand.
